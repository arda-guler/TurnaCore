TurnaCore Instruction Set
= = = = = = = = = = = = =
ADD: Adds value in Register 2 onto Register 1
SUB: Subtracts value in Register 2 from Register 1
MR1: Switches CPU mode to "Modify Register 1"
MR2: Switches CPU mode to "Modify Register 2"
JMP: Switches CPU mode to "Jump"
JG: Switches CPU mode to "Jump" if Register 1 is greater than Register 2; else, switches to a dummy CPU mode
JL: Switches CPU mode to "Jump" if Register 1 is less than Register 2; else, switches to a dummy CPU mode
JE: Switches CPU mode to "Jump" if Register 1 is equal to Register 2; else, switches to a dummy CPU mode
WRITE: Copies Register 1 value to Register 5
RECALL: Copies Register 5 value to Register 1
MEMW: Writes the value in Register 1 onto the memory address determined by Register 2.
MEMR: Reads the value at the memory address determined by Register 2 into Register 1.
HALT: Stops the CPU from performing any more instructions.
