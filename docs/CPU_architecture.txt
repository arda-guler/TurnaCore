TurnaCore Architecture
= = = = = = = = = = = =

The TurnaCore CPU has 5 registers, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Each
register can hold a 16 bit number.

A TurnaCore machine can load a single program into memory (RAM) and
the CPU can read from and write to the memory. Programs loaded into
the RAM can be altered at runtime - of course this does not affect
the source from which the program is loaded. To restore the original
version of a program, simply stopping the machine and reloading it
is enough. However, this means that all the work made at runtime 
up to that point will be reset.

Register 1 and 2 are general registers that can be directly written
on. Addition and subtraction operations act on Register 1.

Register 3 is the operation mode register. It tells the CPU what
to do with the upcoming data to be read.

Register 4 is the memory address register. It keeps track of the 
address from which the instructions/data are being read. It 
increments  automatically and keeps reading the loaded program from 
first instruction to the last, unless a jump command is executed. 
A jump command allows the value of Register 4 to be controlled 
directly, which makes loops, if-else conditionals and goto 
instructions possible.

Register 5 acts as the output register, as well as a short term 
memory register. The value of Register 1 can be copied into 
Register 5, so that the value stored in Register 5 can be copied 
back into Register 1 later on.
