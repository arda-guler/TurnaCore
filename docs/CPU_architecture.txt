TurnaCore CPU Architecture
= = = = = = = = = = = = = =

TurnaCore is under development. The following information is valid
for the current version.

The TurnaCore CPU has 5 registers, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Each
register can hold a number between 00000000 and 11111111. (These
values correspond to 0 and 255 in decimal.)

The TurnaCore CPU can execute programs on the disk, but it can not 
write to the disk.

Register 1 and 2 are general registers that can be directly written
on. Addition and subtraction operations act on Register 1.

Register 3 is the operation mode register. It tells the CPU what
to do with the upcoming numerical value to be read.

Register 4 is the address register. It keeps track of the address
from which the instructions/data are being read. It increments 
automatically and keeps reading the loaded program from first
instruction to the last, unless a jump command is executed. A jump
command allows the value of Register 4 to be controlled directly,
which makes loops, if-else conditionals and goto instructions 
possible.

Register 5 acts as a short term memory register. The value of
Register 1 can be copied into Register 5, so that the value stored 
in Register 5 can be copied into Register 1.
